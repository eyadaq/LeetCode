# LeetCode Practice Workspace

This is my personal workspace to improve problem-solving and logic skills by solving LeetCode questions. Here, I document the questions I've solved along with a brief one-line description for each.

## Questions Solved

1. **Contains Duplicate** - Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

2. **Valid Anagram** - Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

3. **Two Sum** - Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
