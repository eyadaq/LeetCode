# LeetCode Practice Workspace

This is my personal workspace to improve problem-solving and logic skills by solving LeetCode questions. Here, I document the questions I've solved along with a brief one-line description for each.

## Questions Solved

1. **Contains Duplicate** - Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

2. **Valid Anagram** - Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

3. **Two Sum** - Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

4. **Group Anagrams** - Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

5. **Top K Frequent Elements** - Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements within the array.

6. **Encode and Decode Strings** - Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a single string. The encoded string is then decoded back to the original list of strings.

7. **Products of Array Except Self** - Given an integer array nums, return an array output where output[i] is the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
