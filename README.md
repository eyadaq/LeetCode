# LeetCode Practice Workspace

This is my personal workspace to improve problem-solving and logic skills by solving LeetCode questions. Here, I document the questions I've solved along with a brief one-line description for each.

## Questions Solved

# Hash and Arrays Questions : 

1. **Contains Duplicate** - Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

2. **Valid Anagram** - Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

3. **Two Sum** - Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

4. **Group Anagrams** - Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

5. **Top K Frequent Elements** - Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements within the array.

6. **Encode and Decode Strings** - Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a single string. The encoded string is then decoded back to the original list of strings.

7. **Products of Array Except Self** - Given an integer array nums, return an array output where output[i] is the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

8. **Valid Sudoku** - Return true if the Sudoku board is valid, otherwise return false.

9. **Longest Consecutive Sequence** - Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

# Two Pointers :

1. **Valid Palindrome** - Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, otherwise return false.

2. **Two Sum** - Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

3. **Three Sum** - Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.

4. **Container With Most Water** - Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
